Adenita data graph
Part (SM)
	ADNDoubleStrand (StructGroup)
		ADNBaseSegment (StructGroup)
			has a reference to ADNCell
				ADNCell might have references to right and left nucleotides or to right and left loops
	ADNSingleStrand (Chain)
		ADNNucleotide (Residue)
			has references to a pair nucleotide and to the ADNBaseSegment to which it belongs
			ADNBackbone (Backbone)
				ADNAtom (Atom)
			ADNSidechain (Sidechain)
				ADNAtom (Atom)

ADNCell might have references to right and left nucleotides or right and left loops

ADNLoop has a list of references to nucleotides

Aux. reference nodes (like atoms in bonds) to connect single and double strands, base segments and nucleotides?
